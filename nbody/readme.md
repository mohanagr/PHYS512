## How to run this code?

The code in branch `main` has implementations of RK4 and 2 versions of leapfrog
but it's not optimized for speed and efficiency. It'll still run and produce GIF outputs.

If you'd like to have some serious fun with the code I suggest swithcing to branch `stable` which has a very fast and stable
version of the code with Leapfrog only.

The outputs (GIFs, MP4s, and energy values) used in the presentation are present in **final** folder on `main` branch.
