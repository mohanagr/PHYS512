In order to derive the formula for 4-th order accurate derivative, we write down the taylor expansion around x0 for each of

f(x0+h), f(x0-h), f(x0+2h), f(x0-2h)

Thus we have 4 equations, which will allow us to eliminate 3 unknowns and obtain an equation in terms of the 4th unknown - f' . So, we use these equations to eliminate f'', f'''. and f'''' and obtain f' in terms of f'(5).
