*** Identity Noise matrix ***

params of the paraboloid are:
a	= 1.67e-04 +/- 1.71e-08
x0	= -1.36
y0	= 58.22
z0	= -4903.90
Chisq of fit is: 6745.18
RMS studentized err is: 3.78 mm

*** Repeating with a better Noise model (refer readme) ***

params of the paraboloid are:
a	= 1.67e-04 +/- 5.70e-08
x0	= 0.31
