array is:	 [1, 2, 3, 4]
kernel is:	 [0, 1, 0, 0]
DFT conv is:	 [4. 1. 2. 3.]
circular manual conv:	 [4. 1. 2. 3.]
linear conv is:	 [0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 0. 0.]
We expected N+M-1 = 7 elements in our full linear convolution.

This method allows shapes of kernel and array to be different.
E.g. Let's keep kernel [0,1] to shift elements by 1

array is:	 [1, 2, 3, 4]
kernel is:	 [0, 1]
linear conv is:	 [0. 1. 2. 3. 4.]

Example: let's calculate 1-D Gravitational potential

array is:	 [1, 1, 1, 1]
This is array of unit charges
kernel is:	 [100000, 1, 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0]
this is a kernel of 1/r
linear conv is:
 [1.0000000e+05 1.0000100e+05 1.0000150e+05 1.0000183e+05 2.0800000e+00
 1.2050000e+00 7.6750000e-01 4.3750000e-01 1.8750000e-01 6.2500000e-02
 0.0000000e+00]
this is how potential varies on our 1-D grid because of 4 charges.
