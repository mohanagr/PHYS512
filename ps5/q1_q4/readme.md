The correlation of gaussian with itself makes perfect sense. We expect two peaks if we take full FFT (instead of real FFT), since shifting a function by k is equivalent to shifting by (N+k). Or, a shift of 0 (not shifting at all) is basically the same shifting everything by N (and completing a full circle). Thus there are two peaks at 0 and 100.
