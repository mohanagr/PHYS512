A lot of planes have been visualized in the jupyter notebook in the `rough` folder.

Latest versions of Jupyter permit `%matplotlib notebook` to make interactive plots.

I am able to modify Jon's script to make it run on windows (relevant library is `MSVCRT.DLL`) but there is some bug which leads to way too many points being dumped (Jon's file only as about 3000 points). Skipped the last part.
